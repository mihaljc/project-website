# project-website
A practice website made as a learning project in my Front-End development course. Using only HTML and CSS!
This is a work in progress, I intend to add javascript functionality later on it.

All images I'm using are strictly for learning purposes and this project is only a showcase of my coding skills. I am not the owner or do I have any copyrights for these images nor claims. This project is not allowed to be copied or used in whole or parts of it.
